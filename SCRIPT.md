The beginning of the game will start with a short cut scene that will introduce our antagonist (?) and protagonist (Link)

# Intro Cut Scene

#### 1. INT - COMPUTER ROOM - WIDESHOT

We see ? sitting in front of a computer clicking from site to site, with each site visited we can see Link the modem
vomiting information through his information cable. 

#### 2. INT - COMPUTER ROOM - OVER THE SHOULDER ?

You can see a computer on  (Insert some meme website joke here) .com. ? hits a submit button posting something stupid to 
(Insert some meme website joke here) .com.

(For close ups we should be able to just change where the viewport is, this will save on KB ;) 

#### 3. INT - COMPUTER ROOM - CLOSE UP ?

Reaction of ? pleased with his online submission.

#### 4. INT - COMPUTER ROOM - CLOSE UP LINK

Link looks very sickly, it is obvious from his disposition that
serving as a modem only causes him pain and discomfort. 
Link furrows his modem brow and clenches his modem mouth pulling with all his might

#### 5. INT - COMPUTER ROOM - WIDE SHOT

The struggling link breaks free of his ethernet cable and plops to the floor, hopping offscreen. Meanwhile ?'s computer 
turns error red with the numbers 404 flashing on screen.

#### 6. INT - COMPUTER ROOM - CLOSE UP

Reaction shot of ? losing his shit

#Gameplay

Not super solid on what kindof gameplay we will have, I'm thinking it's going to be a continuous sidescroller where 
increasingly difficult obstacles get in your way. Maybe Link can shoot bolts of lightning at obstacles, maybe there can 
pits he can fall into.

# Win Screen

Some kind of cheesy you win screen if all levels of gameplay are completed.

# Death Screen

I'm assuming we start with one catch all "death screen" with a retry and potentially a score display. If we have room 
maybe we can do different short death cutscenes (ex. modem explodes, modem falls into pit etc...)
