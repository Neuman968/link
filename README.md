# 13kb Javascript competition

Ayyyy I made a repo for this shindig.

# TODO

Check out the frameworks on the site for music

Create an outline

Maybe some concept art


## How To

1. If you don't have yarn installed 

`brew install yarn`

2 in the root directory run

`yarn`

to install all of the required dependencies.

3. To build the project from the root folder run 

`yarn run build`

This will build dist/b.js which stands for bundle. This is what we will use to load the project. 
Eventually we should make this inline in the HTML.
